repo of random unfinished and unloved sl-sh scripts and artifacts idea is they
will get attention one day.

distributed between
.config/so-lush/
and
.local/share/so-lush/

maybe one day it will be a rich vibrant collection of scripts that serves
as  a blueprint for https://github.com/sstanfield/sl-sh/issues/71
